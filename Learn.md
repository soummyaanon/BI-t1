# Learning Experience

## Technologies Used

### HTML
I utilized HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to structure the content of my portfolio website. HTML provides the foundation for organizing text, images, and other elements in a web page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Portfolio</title>
    <!-- Add your other meta tags, stylesheets, and scripts here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was employed for styling and layout purposes. It allowed me to enhance the visual appeal of my portfolio by applying colors, fonts, and positioning elements.

/* Your CSS styles go here */
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    /* Add more styles as needed */
}
JavaScript
JavaScript added interactivity to my portfolio. I used it to create dynamic elements, handle user input, and make my website more engaging.
// Your JavaScript code goes here
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Handle button click event
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
3D Particles
To enhance the user experience, I incorporated 3D particles into the design. This adds a visually appealing and interactive element to the website.
<!-- Include the library or script for 3D particles -->
<script src="path/to/particles.js"></script>

<!-- Initialize and configure 3D particles -->
<script>
    particlesJS('particles-js', {
        // Your particle configuration goes here
    });
</script>
